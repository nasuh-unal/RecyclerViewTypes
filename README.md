RecyclerView Types
==================================


Introduction
------------

In this project, I researched RecyclerView types. I understood the working logic of RcyclerView. I did research on different types of RcyclerView.
I listed the daily tasks to be done as a list. In the ViewTypes module, I divided the lists into two different types.
